### üéØ Motivation

This project demonstrates how **homography estimation** can be used to warp and blend images into panoramic mosaics. Unlike using ready-made libraries (e.g., OpenCV's `stitcher()`), this pipeline was built **entirely from scratch in Python**, providing deep understanding of projective geometry, matrix decomposition, and blending challenges.

### üß† Theoretical Background

Given two images of a planar scene, their relation is modeled by a **homography matrix** \(H\):

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
\sim
H \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where:

$$
H =
\begin{bmatrix}
h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13} \\
h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23} \\
h_{31} & h_{32} & h_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To estimate \(H\):

1. Collect \(n\) point pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) ‚Üî \((x'_i, y'_i)\).
2. Formulate the system:

$$
A \cdot h = 0
$$

with \(A\) of shape \(2n \times 9\).
3. Solve using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:

$$
A = U \cdot S \cdot V^T
$$

The last column of \(V\) reshaped to \(3 \times 3\) gives \(H\).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Highlights

**Core Components:**

- **Point Selection**  
  Manual selection via `matplotlib.ginput()`.
- **Homography Estimation**  
  SVD-based solver: `compute_homography()`.
- **Backward Warping**  
  Transforming the target image: `warp()`.
- **Blending**  
  Offset-aware mosaics: `blend2images()` and `blend3images()`.

**Interpolation:**  
Nearest-neighbor was used for simplicity; bilinear can be integrated later.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pipeline Overview

A Python program was developed to stitch two or more input images together into a single panoramic image. The process consists of **four main modules**:

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Point Selection**  
Given two images, corresponding points are selected either interactively (using `ginput`) or via predetermined coordinates. The selection quality is critical‚Äîstitching errors are most often due to:  
- The number of points chosen  
- Their spatial distribution across the images  
- The precise ordering of point pairs  

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Homography Estimation**  
A **homography matrix \(H\)** is computed to map points from the source image plane to the destination (base) image plane, aligning them geometrically. In this work, **singular value decomposition (SVD)** was used to solve the overdetermined system of equations and estimate the best-fit homography. For example, `paris_b` was used as the base image and `paris_a` or `paris_c` as sources.

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Image Warping**  
A custom warping function takes the source image and the computed homography matrix \(H\) to generate a **warped image projected into the base image‚Äôs plane**. This project employed **backward warping**, which iterates over destination pixels and maps them to source coordinates using the inverse homography.

---

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Blending Images**  
Finally, the **blending step** combines the warped images and the base image into a seamless mosaic. For stitching three images, a dedicated method (`blend3images`) was implemented, accepting the base image, two warped images, and their corresponding offsets in x and y directions. The function assembles all parts into the final composite panorama.

---

‚úÖ **Summary of Steps**
To create a stitched panorama, **these four steps must be followed in sequence**:

1. Select corresponding points carefully.
2. Compute the homography matrix via SVD.
3. Warp the source image(s) onto the destination plane.
4. Blend all images into a single mosaic.

### üñºÔ∏è Intermediate Warping Example

Below you see the **step-by-step warping process** on the Paris dataset:

- **Base image**:

- **Warped source images**:

  ![Warped Paris A](/assets/img/projects/5_project/warped_paris_a.jpg)

  ![Warped Paris C](/assets/img/projects/5_project/warped_paris_c.jpg)

- **Blended result of two images**:

### üìù Reflections

- **Point Selection:** The single most important factor in quality.
- **SVD Stability:** Robust as long as outliers were minimized.
- **Blending:** Simple overlap merging causes visible seams; advanced blending is a future improvement.
- **Learning Outcome:** Implementing the full pipeline manually provided deep intuition into each step of homography-based stitching.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack

- **Language:** Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **Algorithm:** Homography estimation via SVD
- **Warping:** Backward mapping with nearest-neighbor interpolation
- **Blending:** Custom mosaic assembly
