### ‚ú® Motivation

This project investigated how **dynamic, context-aware adaptation** can improve human activity recognition (HAR) on wrist-worn devices. Unlike static pipelines with fixed sampling and feature extraction, this system **adjusts configurations at runtime** based on activity complexity to balance **accuracy, battery consumption, and computational cost**.

#### üö¶ 1. State Detection Module
- **Purpose:** Identify if the current activity is *simple* or *complex*.
- **How it works:**
  - Reads accelerometer (ACC) data in sliding windows.
  - If the last detected state was complex, gyroscope (GYR) data are also read.
  - Uses a **rule-based algorithm** (Section 3.3 of the paper) to decide state transitions.
  - If an activity persists for >60 seconds, it triggers a classification phase.

---

#### üóÇÔ∏è 2. Session Module
- **Purpose:** Track sessions of the same activity over time.
- **Functionality:**
  - Determines whether the activity already exists in the dictionary.
  - Updates average F1-score and occurrence count.
  - Prepares session context for classification.

---

#### üß© 3. Classification Module
- **Purpose:** Classify the detected session with an appropriate model.
- **Dynamic configuration:**
  - *Simple Session:*
    - Low-frequency sampling
    - Lightweight feature set
    - ACC data only
  - *Complex Session:*
    - High-frequency sampling
    - Richer feature set
    - ACC + GYR data
  - The module then computes the F1-score and updates session metrics.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

**Sensor and Data Configurations**
- **Sensors:** 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope
- **Sampling Rates:** 1 Hz to 50 Hz
- **Window Sizes:** 5‚Äì30 seconds
- **Feature Types:**
  - Statistical (mean, std, range)
  - Frequency domain (energy, entropy)

**Dynamic Adaptation**
- The state detection algorithm automatically:
  - Reduces sampling when the user is static
  - Switches to richer features and higher sampling when complex motion is detected
- This ensures **energy savings without compromising classification performance**.

### üß™ Results and Insights

**Resource and Performance Comparison**
Experiments evaluated Static, Semi-Dynamic, and Dynamic configurations:

- **Static:** Always uses full sensor set and highest sampling.
- **Semi-Dynamic:** Varies sampling rate.
- **Dynamic:** Varies sampling, feature set, and sensor usage.

**Key Findings:**
- Dynamic configuration achieved **highest F1-score (0.78)** while:
  - Reducing CPU time by ~15%
  - Decreasing energy consumption by ~38%
  - Lowering memory usage

**Visual Results:**
