### ✨ Motivation

This project demonstrates how a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** can learn a compressed probabilistic representation of high-dimensional data. Unlike standard autoencoders, VAEs introduce a structured latent space by modeling distributions, enabling generative sampling of new data instances. The goal was to implement a VAE from scratch on the MNIST dataset and analyze reconstruction fidelity and latent space interpolation.

### 🧩 Method Overview

Variational Autoencoders combine two key components:

- An **encoder network** that maps input data to latent variables parameterized as Gaussian distributions (means and variances).
- A **decoder network** that reconstructs images from latent samples.

During training, the objective is to balance:

- **Reconstruction loss** (how accurately the input is reproduced).
- **KL-divergence loss** (regularization that keeps the latent space close to a standard normal distribution).

This approach enables both accurate reconstruction and smooth sampling of new digit images.
